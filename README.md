# PDE_time_age_mass
Code associated with Extending Analytical Solutions to Age-Mass Models of a Population


Folders:

Data/
Includes all simulated data necessary to generate figure from the manuscript. Details on the parameter and functional forms used for each file are found in PlotData.m in the comments. These data can be generated from Analytical3D.m, but modifications in the parameters and functional forms are required.

Figures/
Includes all subfigures from the manuscript (in .png and .fig formats). These can be generated by running PlotData.m.



Matlab Functions:


Analytical3D.m
Produces simulated data related to the parameters and functional forms chosen. An example is encoded with g(t,a) = 1, g(m) = 1, \delta = 0, and standard initial conditions. Output is automatically saved as ?Output.mat.?

DefineFunctions.m
For inputted functional forms of g(t,a) and g(m), the necessary functions are displayed. These need to be changed in Analytical3D.m in accordance with the chosen functional forms. An example is encoded with g(t,a) = a and g(m) = 2*m.

PlotData.m
Plots simulated data files found in ?Data/? to produce all subfigures found in the manuscript. Will deposit .png and .fig figures into ?Figures/? folder. Commented details on the numerical referencing of versions and associated parameterization are found in the comments.
